# IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) in GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) Calls

This repository holds planning docs, notes, and any related docs around open, informal calls to discuss IPFS (and related IP* specifications/tools) projects by, for, and in partnership with Cultural Heritage Institutions (GLAM = Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums).

## Take Part

Anyone is welcome to join a call. We do ask that you try to follow the [Recurse Center's Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) in order to keep this informal working space as open and inclusive as possible.

If you'd like to present, demo, or walk through your IPFS work on a call, either create a pull request for this repository that adds your name and topic to this file, or volunteer the idea on a call or via the other communication channels.
